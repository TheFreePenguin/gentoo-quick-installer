# gentoo-quick-installer-tfp

## About

This is a fork of a quick installer script that can be used to bootstrap amd64 Gentoo Linux quickly.

Script has been tested on VirtualBox. Other platforms could require additional manual tunining.

Anyway, it is simple, minimalistic, easy to read and easy to tune for your needs.
